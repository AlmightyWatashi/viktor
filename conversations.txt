Would you like to have a chat during this time we spend traveling?
	+ Of course I would, sir.

	Traveling in silence is the worst kind of travel next to traveling in the electric tram.
		Truer words have rarely been spoken.
		[section hello]

end
== hello ==

	- My name is Viktor.
		Pleased to meet you.
		[set knowsname 1]
		My name is Wells. Herbert G. Wells.
			[section hello]
	-[if knowsname = 1] You are Herbert Wells, the writer? Wow, I read both your books and loved them!
		[set librarian_flag 1]
		I wrote about ten different books, actually.
			[section hello]		
	-[if librarian_flag = 1] My local library kinda sucks.
		[set librarysucks = 1]
		That is tremendously sad to hear.
			+ I'm working on improving that real soon.
				[set repair_flag 1]
					[section hello]
	-[if librarian_flag = 1] You wrote ten books? Incredible! Do you have any with you?
		Unfortunately, I do not.
		But if you are literary afficionado, then you must also enjoy music.
			+ Oh yes. Mozart, Dvorak, even the modern stuff like Joplin.
				Exquisite choice.
				I recently tried listening to some Saint-Saens.
					+ Charles-Camille Saint-Saens? I love the Carnival of Animals!
						That goes without question.
						But my current favorite is the Cello Concerto in A-Minor.
						Beautiful music for rainy weather.
						I even bought an extra record to listen to, during my travel.
						I can give it to you if you want.
							+ Oh, I couldn't really.
								I insist
									+ Well, if you insist...
										[record saens]
										[section hello]						
	- So, where are you from?
		I'm from the Unwanted kingdom.
		[set from_talked 1][add vienna_travel 1]
		But I have been visiting Austria-Hungary so often that it became my second home.		
			[section hello]
	-[if from_talked = 1] You travel here often because you prefer a bit warmer climate?
		For starters, I prefer the climate with less plague.
		[add vienna_travel 1]
			[section hello]
	-[if from_talked = 1] Are you traveling on business or pleasure?
		Let's just say I have a feeling that something important will happen on this journey.
		[add vienna_travel 1]
			[section hello]	
	-[if repair_flag = 1] I hope you won't mind seeing a new emperor of Austria-Hungary.
		I didn't know the empire plans on switching to democratic elections.
		[set ouster_talked 1]
			+ I'm not sure what you mean by ''elections''.
			But I've heard of ''democracy''. It's when idiotic majority rules over the intelligent minority.
				But democracy might have its advantages and opportunities.
				Especially for an eloquent person of the lower class, such as yourself.
					[section hello]		
	-[if ouster_talked = 1] I'm actually traveling to Vienna to oust the emperor.
	How's that for an opportunity?
		Sounds very ambitious.
		You think that ousting the emperor would improve this country's progress?
			+ Unquestionably! Everything would be better with me as an emperor! Everything!
				For you personally, I'm sure everything would be better.
				But do you think that other people would be better off with someone...
				Who wasn't educated all his life to rule a country?
					+ Are we talking about the educated ruler who sends his own people to wars?
						[animation player spr_viktor_talk_left_coupe 5]Ah, I heard he is preparing that unfortunate war with the Macedonian republic due to their debts.
						[animation player spr_viktor_talk_left_coupe 5]So, the goal of your travel is, in fact, stopping the war?
							+ That is one of the main reasons.
							War is just a massive slaughterhouse in the name of somebody who sees you as a number on a piece of paper
							Or as a foreigner.
							Or as a Slav.
							Or a poor person.
							I could go on.
								Understandably.
									+ This weather is kinda scaring me.
										[section falling_dirigible]
					+ You mean that educated ruler known for discriminating against people for their nationality or gender?
						[animation player spr_viktor_talk_left_coupe 5]Nationality, religion, breed, social class...
						[animation player spr_viktor_talk_left_coupe 5]Everyone discriminates in a way.
						[animation player spr_viktor_talk_left_coupe 5]It's just that it's really obvious with an emperor.
						[animation player spr_viktor_talk_left_coupe 5]All eyes are constantly on him.
							+ That's precisely why he should set a better example!
							Besides, he is, er...
							Sorry, I got distracted with the weather outside.

	+ Manouvering this blimp around so many clouds might become really hard for the pilot.
		[animation player spr_viktor_talk_left_coupe 5]Oh, you are also familiar with dirigible piloting?
		[animation player spr_viktor_talk_left_coupe 5]You are truly a multi-talented person.
			+ I recently had the opportunity to try piloting a personal blimp.
				[animation player spr_viktor_talk_left_coupe 5]Then you know that it is perfectly safe in the hands of a professional.
				I mean, what's the worst that can happen?
				[cloud phone][cloud 580 200][animation player spr_viktor_talk_left_coupe 5][talk coupe_megaphone][blocksound snd_donkey_talk_muffled] Dearest passangers, your pilot is talking to you, we are losing height.
				[cloud phone][cloud 580 200][animation player spr_viktor_talk_left_coupe 5][talk coupe_megaphone][blocksound snd_donkey_talk_muffled2] More to the point, we are falling and we are all about to die. 
				[cloud phone][cloud 580 200][animation player spr_viktor_talk_left_coupe 5][talk coupe_megaphone][blocksound snd_donkey_talk_muffled3] Stay on your seats, there is no need to panic because there is nothing to be done.
				[cloud phone][cloud 580 200][animation player spr_viktor_talk_left_coupe 5][talk coupe_megaphone][blocksound snd_donkey_talk_muffled4] The real reason why we are falling is that I went on strike so I do not pilot anymore today.
				[cloud phone][cloud 580 200][animation player spr_viktor_talk_left_coupe 5][talk coupe_megaphone][blocksound snd_donkey_talk_muffled5] Thank you for traveling with us. 
				[cloud phone][cloud 580 200][animation player spr_viktor_talk_left_coupe 5][talk coupe_megaphone][blocksound snd_donkey_talk_muffled] Also please stop smoking in cabins because smoking kills. 
					+ Oh no no no.
					I will not end this way!
					No one will!
					Excuse me while I break into the pilot's cabin.
						For such a commendable attempt, you may be excused.

			[section hello]

				Oh...
				Now that I think about it, we really shouldn't cut you into pieces.
				It is obvious that you're an escapee from a mental hospital.
				[talk hyena]So, cutting you into pieces would be really rude of us.
					[section army]
			- Would you like me to be your emperor? I would be a much better emperor!
				Really?
				How much would you pay us?
					+ Hmmm... 30 coins a month?
						[set mood scared]
						[talk hyena] Ahahahah ihihihihi ohohho!
						We earn 90 coins a month now.
							+ Really? 90 coins? That... that's nice.
							I did not earn half that much even when I won a naked boxing tournament.
								Yes we are royal guard, you oversized moron
								And we are not Slavs or some other nonsense ethnic group.
								So we deserve good pay.
								[talk hyena] hihi Yes.

				[talk hyena] Like Miyamoto Wasabi, but worse!

			This was all a test. I am in disguise.
			[set mood angry]
			And I must say I'm not happy with your job!
				Really? Why?
					+ You were supposed to cut me into pieces.
					Or at least arrest me and bring me to justice.
					And you did none of those things!
						Well, we can cut you into pieces now if you insist.
							+ Now when you know that I'm your superior?
							I would have to throw you in jail after that.
							You cannot attack your superior!
							What did they teach you in that army school of yours?
								I'm sorry commander,
								Next time we will cut into pieces anyone who looks as suspicious as you do.
									[section so]

							[direction right] How come I don't hear you laughing anymore?
							You did not do your job properly!
							You had to kill me or let the emperor judge me!
							Because you know how much he loves to judge.

								So what?
									+ Will you kill me or not?
										But you are our commander, commander.
										We cannot do that.

	[imagespeeds lake 0.4]
	[talk lake][animations lake spr_lake_talk] Oh all right.
	[soundtrack bach]
	There you go, it's more or less unanimous.
	Short version of the plan, we need money for everything so we'll rob a bank.
	[talk horse1] What?
	[talk mole] Ooh, I like that plan. Does it include shovels?
	It might.
	[talk matilda_tavern] How about guns?
	Hopefully not.
	[talk matilda_tavern] Then I like the plan as well.
	Then it's settled. Tomorrow we head for Budapest.
	[talk horse2] You don't mean the national bank?
	[talk horse1] That bank has the best protection in the empire.
	[talk horse2] It's sealed and full of armed guards from all sides.
	[talk mole] All sides but one.
	[talk mole] Oh yes, this plan is definitely going to include shovels.
