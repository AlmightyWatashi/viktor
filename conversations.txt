[if attar_seen = 0] Viktor, is that you?
[if attar_seen = 0][set attar_seen 1] I almost had trouble recognizing you out of your work uniform.
How is life fairing for you, Viktor?

== hello ==

	+ Attar, my friend! You are the perfect man to join me in overthrowing the emperor.
		Viktor, my dear friend.
		[set chitchat_flag 1]
		You keep choosing battles you cannot win.
		It is long past your time to improve this empire by raising some children of your own.
			+ I will improve this empire once I finally get to control it.
				Controlling the empire is not like controlling the broomstick.
				It's a bureaucratic nightmare.
				And a moral hell.
					- There are experts to take care of that. Emperor's job is just a lot of simple political and military decisions.
						[section notsure]
					- I don't think I would do a worse job then generations of inbred show dogs.
						The emperor is cruel, yet effective.
						You are a nice and intelligent person, until anger starts controlling you.
						Rage is one of seven thieves inside us, Viktor.
						Learn to subdue it, and you might become good emperor material.
							[section thief]
			+ This can be won, Attar! Nobody really expects a person to just march into the palace and overthrow the emperor.
				[section notsure]
	+ Why are you still doing this dead end job?
		Making steam toys, my friend, is a great way to earn extra pocket change.
		[set chitchat_flag 1]
		[if bought_cell_flag = 1][set toys_flag 1]
		Unfortunately, street sweeping is still a job that feeds my family.
			+ What about that job doing technical support over telephones?
				Ah...
				They expect a person to speak fluently in nine different European languages.
				When it comes to European languages, I'm fluent in only seven of them.
					[section hello]
			+ You should do like me! Yell at the boss, break stuff in his office and graffiti the place with stories about his mother!
				I will be honest.
				The look of that bastard's office did not displease me.
				I even bought a few photographs that Robert took after you left.
				My wife decided to make some beautiful wooden frames for them.
				But still, you must find a way to control your anger, my friend.
				Rage is one of the seven thieves inside us.
					[section thief]
	-[if chitchat_flag = 1] Why is your land named Gangrene anyway?
		Some people say that it's a derivative of the river Ganges.
		But actually, it's because some idiot let the explorers of Unwanted Kingdom put that name on the map.
			+ Interesting
				Wait until you learn about Abyssinia.
					[section hello]
			+ And what would be the correct translation of your country's name?
				Necrosis.
					[section hello]
	-[if toys_flag = 1] I love your toys! Did you build anything new recently?
		Nothing exciting, I'm afraid.
		I have mostly been making spare parts for the airport's flying shuttles.
			+ So, if I described you a broken part of the airport shuttle, you could make me one?
				Possibly.
				But I might need some metal to build it with.
				Or money, money can easily be converted into anything.
					+ Do you accept IOU's from a future emperor?
						I would have enough trouble accepting IOU's from the current emperor.

						Otherwise, I would have to work in a factory.

		Those things are high production value.
		And I'm sure they could be used in those little shuttle blimps to fire up the afterburner.
		But it's electrical, I just work with steam machinery.

				My wife hates the mess in the basement already, I can't start filling it with electric parts as well.

Even if that were true...
Do you really think that everyone will just listen to you because you are the one on the throne?
	+ Of course they would. It's not a big secret that the emperor replaced most of his personal guard with automatons!
		That may be the case.
		But still, your endeavors are risky and I have a family to take care of.
			[section hello]
	+ Would you listen?
		Good point.
		But it's still too risky for myself.
		My wife would kill me.
			[section hello]

	- There is nothing wrong with getting a blackout-inducing bloodlust from time to time. It helped me a lot in prison.
		Please, Viktor. No more prison stories.
		You have been there less then a year and it's like you have a different story for each day.
			[section hello]
	- Again with you and your thieves. I won't be surprised if you stop making toys and start making alarm systems.
		[set toys_flag 1]
		You cannot put an alarm system on your soul.
		But you can conjure an alarm system in your mind.
		Try to remember this the next time you get angry.
		Or get a girlfriend, that seems to help as well.

					[section hello]
	-[if librarian_flag = 1] You wrote ten books? Incredible! Do you have any with you?
		Unfortunately, I do not.
		But if you are literary afficionado, then you must also enjoy music.
			+ Oh yes. Mozart, Dvorak, even the modern stuff like Joplin.
				Exquisite choice.
				I recently tried listening to some Saint-Saëns.
					+ Charles-Camille Saint-Saens? I love the Carnival of Animals!
						That goes without question.
						But my current favorite is the Cello Concerto in A Minor.
						Beautiful music for rainy weather.

		I didn't know the empire plans on switching to democratic elections.
		[set ouster_talked 1]

				When you simplify it that much, yes, it's something like that.
				But democracy might have it's advantages and opportunities.
				Especially for an eloquent person of the lower class, such as yourself.
					[section hello]

		Sounds very ambitous.
		You think that ousting the emperor would improve this country's progress?

				For you personally, I'm sure everything would be better.
				But do you think that other people would be better off with someone...
				Who wasn't educated all his life to rule a country?
					+ Are we talking about the educated ruler who sends his own people to wars?
					[set mood scared]
						Ah, I heard he is preparing that unfortunate war with the Macedonian republic due to their debts.
						So, the goal of your travel is, in fact, stopping the war?

							War is just a massive slaughterhouse in the name of somebody who sees you as a number on a piece of paper
							Or as a foreigner.
							Or as a Slav.
							Or a poor person.
							I could go on.
								Understandably.
									+ This weather is kinda scaring me.
										[section falling_dirigible]

					[set mood scared]
						Nation, religion, breed, social class...
						Everyone discriminates in a way.
						It's just that it's really obvious with an emperor.
						All eyes are constantly on him.
